# Multiply-Glitch-Doom Invader (Tkinter Experiment)

Want to see what digital doom/destruction looks like?

This is a silly, chaotic little Tkinter experiment written in Python.
It spawns multiple windows, escalates visual noise, displays an invader popup,
plays a jumpscare sound, and exits on ESC.

This is my **first ever Python GUI project**, made purely on a whim. Intentionally dramatic and not meant to be serious.
